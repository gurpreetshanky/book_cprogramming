# Professional C programming : Framework and plugin design in C

I first met the C language 20 years ago. I have been working with C language for 12 years.
I have read several C programming books, but their purpose is to teach how to start programming in C.
There is no book about program in C practically for a real product.
Fortunately, I have learned good C programming skill when working for companies that have good C programmers and good development process.
I have also seen how great C programmers develop large scale software, from the Linux kernel sources.

This document is some part of what I have learned and seen.

For students, this document takes one or two weeks. Please focus on how the C basics, such as function pointer, pointer, macro and etc, are used in the real product.
If you are already a professional C programmer, you could compare the source of this document and your product. I would be happy if you find something that can be applied to your product.

Please let me know if you have any tips for practical C programming skills. Please register your tips in the ticket of this repository. I will write a document for it and add here with your name.
